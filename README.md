## About...

### Overkill projects

A project with (overkill) is a project that does that task... but, also does a _bit_ more. Like instead of printing out a static TicTacToe board, a [full TicTacToe game](./outputExercises.ticTacToe)...

### Wip projects

A project with (wip) is work-in-progress. It's not done yet.
