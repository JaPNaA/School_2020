# School\_2020

school, um, stuff. in 2020.

## Utilities

Things I've made so I can be lazier

  - [j](./j)
    - Compile and run .java files
    - Make sure you remember `javac` and `java` commands, even if you don't use those after switching

## Lessons

  - Module 1 Java Introduction: [hello](./hello)
  - Module 2 Output Exercises: [outputExercises](./outputExercises), [TicTacToe (overkill)](./outputExercises.ticTacToe)

## About...

### Overkill projects

A project with (overkill) is a project that does that task... but, also does a _bit_ more. Like instead of printing out a static TicTacToe board, a [full TicTacToe game](./outputExercises.ticTacToe)...

### Wip projects

A project with (wip) is work-in-progress. It's not done yet.
